Brian Burke wanted to rebuild but then suddenly traded away three draft choices, including two number ones, to acquire Phil Kessel. It seems doubtful that Shanahan will be lured into the same trap; unlike Burke Shanahan seems to have his ego under control."

President Paul Beeston is on record stating that this year�s payroll will be the same as last year�s�$137 million. Using advanced mathematics needed to figure out the difference I have the Jays with $11 million in the bank. General Manager Alex Anthopoulos had worked in previous years under the illusion that more money could be had if asked. Beeston always said that he had never gone to the board and asked for money and been turned down. Whether he never asked or whether Beeston was the one cutting AA off the Jays were never able to add payroll. This year AA has left some wiggle room to add either a big fish at the deadline or several useful guppies. The big fish would be a number one starting pitcher�like Cincinnati�s Johnny Cueto. All indications are that the Reds will not be able to sign Cueto and with this being the final year of his contract if the Reds fall out of contention, which many experts predicts will happen, then Cueto will likely be available. A deal will need to be reached but for the Jays it will be a matter of players, the additional money will not be an issue."

They can play so well�they�ve beaten Cleveland, Toronto twice, Portland, Golden State�and afterward put fear in the minds of their opponents. The Cavs pretty much tanked a couple of games against Boston to play the Celtics in the first round and avoid the Nets. Then the Nets lay consecutive eggs in late season games that will determine whether they make the playoffs. The Nets were blown out in games 80 and 81 scoring 73 and 86 points versus Milwaukee and Chicago. Now the Nets are on the verge of missing the playoffs entirely. No doubt the fear they once created in others has vanished."
