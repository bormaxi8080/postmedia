Sometimes that kind of popularity crosses over into real life and real cookbooks that earn real money, often not. Not only did it cross over, but Perelman has found herself keeping company with the likes of Martha Stewart and doing interviews with Forbes, NPR and the world�s biggest newspapers."

The Chocolate Silk Pie is the sort of thing that people drive for hours to order at an isolated but inexplicably popular diner."
