Angello told Billboard he aimed to create a �piece of art,� and Wild Youth is certainly epic and emotionally charged. Most songs feature a singer, a story (innocence vs. experience is the overarching theme) and cinematic, soaring melodies. Some critics are calling the dramatic project one of the most important EDM releases of the year. Meanwhile, club kids will be satisfied with the driving banger Kamikaze."

The album and single Promises reached No. 1 on the UK charts, and the group worked with Baz Luhrmann on the soundtrack to his version of The Great Gatsby. Back in 2011, incorporating grandiose pop elements into dubstep was a big deal. Now EDM artists have moved on. Experimental noise and psychedelia are making waves. But Nero�s second album Between II Worlds delivers more stadium-sized electroclash. Not a bad thing; but not thrilling like first time."

But a year later Prydz stopped playing it altogether, favouring his newer tracks. Now the musician has the best of both worlds: recognition in the underground scene as Cirez D, and an open invitation to entertain main room masses using his Eric Prydz moniker. In July, Prydz was the first DJ with a set featured on Beats 1, the radio station on Apple Music. EPIC, or Eric Prydz In Concert has gained a stellar reputation for mesmerizing visuals and 3-D technology."
